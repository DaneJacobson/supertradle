Multidimensional approaches to economic complexity solve this problem by combining data on international trade, patents, and research papers.

Yet, some students may be guessing their answers, so a correct answer means more if it is coming from a student that answered most questions correctly.","eci-intuituvely3":"This thought experiment should give you the basic intuition behind economic complexity.

The general idea is that the activities present, produced, or exported from a location, carry information about the complexity of that location, while the locations where an activity is present carry information about the complexity required to perform an activity. For instance, we can say that cities like San Francisco, Boston, and New York, are complex, because they are home to complex activities.

A dataset contains all data related to a particular topic from a particular source. For instance: you will see multiple datasets for international trade because we have a variety of different product classifications: SITC (Standard International Trade Classification), HS (Harmonized System) as well as different revisions like HS92 (1992 revision of the Harmonized System), HS96 (1996 revision of the Harmonized System) and so on.","datasetsDesc1":"Data in each cube can be disaggregated by dimension. We can imagine a dimension as an edge of a cube, where the edge length depends on the dimension. As you may see a dimension is just a variable by which we can group by.","datasetsDesc2":"In conclusion, cubes store a huge amount of data at the most disaggregate level. Storing data in this way allows for the ultimate level flexibility as columns can always be marginalized over and their values aggregated.","drilldowns":"Drilldowns","drilldownsDesc":"Drilldowns are dataset dimensions. Thinking of datasets using a cube metaphor, the dimensions would be the edges. By default a dataset would be aggregated by all dimensions, choosing one from the drilldown menu allows us to disaggregate by that dimension.","drilldownsDesc1":"Taking the German regional dataset as an example, it has Time, Region and Product type as dimensions. Each dimension will appear as a drilldown at OEC API. So, the first step to create a request will be to specify at least one drilldown in order to retrieve data for that specific variable.","drilldownsDesc2":"Often times there will be a need to group data by different hierarchical levels. Say for instance we start our analysis by retrieving yearly trade data and want to move to a higher level of granulairy, say quarters or months. This is why dimensions also support different levels of hierarchy. Levels of hierarchy are a great way to group data while respecting the inherent hierarchy of the classification. We refer to levels of hierarchy in dimensions that have sub dimensions in their definition. For example, regions can be grouped by country and countries can be grouped by continent.","drilldownsDesc3":"When we create a query using the Data Explorer we have to decide which level of hierarchy we want to group the data and which levels to include.","measures":"Measures","measuresDesc":"Every cube contains different measures. This is why depending on the cube and dimensions selected for a query there will be different measures available. Measures are data values which can be aggregated. Measure can support different types of aggregations, such as sum, mean, min or max. Because of this, measures are usually integers, floats or percentages variables. In our case, examples of measures are trade value, weight, quantity, etc.","cuts":"Cuts","cutsDesc":"Cuts allow us to filter the data based on a specific member of a chosen dimension. For example, if we were using the US subnational cube and wanted to see export data from the state of Colorado (instead of showing all states) we would cut on that particular member.","advancedOptions":"Advanced Options","advancedOptionsDebug":"Debug MDX","advancedOptionsDebugDesc":": This option enables the debug tool, which will indicate where the error is when a query is not working properly.","advancedOptionsDistinct":"Apply distinct","advancedOptionsDistinctDesc":": This option acts as a filter, which will filter duplicated IDs, leaving only unique values.","advancedOptionsEmpty":"Only return non-empty data","advancedOptionsEmptyDesc":": This option will skip results with missing values.","advancedOptionsParent":"Include parents levels","advancedOptionsParentDesc":": This option will include the parent dimensions in the query, for drilldowns that have a parent dimensions to add.","advancedOptionsOptimize":"Optimize sparse results","advancedOptionsOptimizeDesc":": This option will skip rows where the measure is a null value."},"visualize":{"tooltip":{"more":"Click for More Information"}}}},"legal":{"privacy":"/en/resources/privacy","terms":"/en/resources/terms"},"loading":false,"loadingProgress":{"requests":4,"fulfilled":4},"location":{"basename":"/","host":"oec.world","hostname":"oec.world","href":"https://oec.world/en/visualize/embed/tree_map/hs92/export/gib/usa/show/2021/?controls=false&title=false&click=false","origin":"https://oec.world","pathname":"/en/visualize/embed/tree_map/hs92/export/gib/usa/show/2021/","port":"80","protocol":"https:","query":{"controls":"false","title":"false","click":"false"},"search":"?controls=false&title=false&click=false"},"mailgun":true,"routing":{"locationBeforeTransitions":null},"services":["GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER"],"social":[],"cms":{"status":{"diffCounter":0,"translationCounter":0,"translationError":false,"previews":null,"query":{},"pathObj":{}},"cubeData":false,"profiles":[],"stories":[],"formatters":[],"resources":{"formatterFunctions":{}},"variables":{}},"explorer":{"explorerServer":{"cubeMap":{},"endpoint":"aggregate","localeOptions":["en"],"software":"","url":"","version":""},"explorerLoading":{"error":null,"loading":true,"status":"FETCHING","trigger":null},"explorerQueries":{"current":"default","itemMap":{"default":{"created":"2023-06-06T07:27:49.442Z","key":"default","label":"","isDirty":true,"params":{"booleans":{},"cube":"","cuts":{},"drilldowns":{},"filters":{},"growth":{},"locale":"","measures":{},"pagiLimit":0,"pagiOffset":0,"rca":{},"sortDir":"desc","sortKey":"","topk":{}},"result":{"data":[],"error":null,"headers":{},"sourceCall":"","status":0,"urlAggregate":"","urlLogicLayer":""}}}}},"vizbuilder":{"data":[],"loading":true,"status":200,"countryMembers":[],"wdiIndicators":[],"cubeSelected":{"geoItems":[],"geoLevels":[],"name":"","port":false,"productItems":[],"productLevels":[],"timeItems":[],"timeLevels":[],"title":""},"cubeSelectedTemp":{"geoItems":[],"geoLevels":[],"name":"","port":false,"productItems":[],"productLevels":[],"timeItems":[],"timeLevels":[],"title":""},"axisConfig":{"xConfig":{"id":"","title":"","scale":"","selected":"Log"},"yConfig":{"id":"","title":"","scale":"","selected":"Log"}}},"rankings":{"loading":false,"data":{},"current":false},"trends":{"cart":[],"cartLoading":false,"countries":["afzaf","aschn","asind","asjpn","askor","asmys","asphl","assau","assgp","astur","eubel","eudeu","euesp","eugbr","euirl","eunld","eunor","euprt","eurus","euswe","nacan","nausa","ocaus","sabra","sabol","sachl","saecu"],"disaggregationParams":null,"flow":"2","focused":["reporter","World","Country"],"highlight":{},"highlightLevel":"Country","levelPartner":null,"levelProduct":null,"levelReporter":null,"permalinkRef":true,"refDelta":"1","scale":"linear","timeFrame":["201801","202306"],"value":"Trade Value USD","vizType":"LinePlot"},"searchVisible":false,"settings":{"theme":"light"},"stripeUser":{}}');
